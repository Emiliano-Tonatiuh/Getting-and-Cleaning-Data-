'X_test / train' contains the observations
'y_test / train' contains the activity type
'Features' Contains the names of the columns of the 'X_test / train' files


The union of type of activity, observations and names of the columns is obtained in the lines of code.
Xtrain <- read.table (DireccionTrain, ....)
features <- read.table (". \\ Getting and Cleaning Data \\ ...)
colnames (Xtrain) = features [, 2]
TypeOfActivity <-read.table (DirectionTrainy .....)
Xtrain <-cbind (TypeOfActivity, Xtrain)

The same should be done for test files, that is in the variable

Xtest <-cbind (TypeOfActivity2, Xtest)

then they must join

mergedata <- rbind (Xtest, Xtrain)

columns with the words average or standard deviation in


Average <- (grepl ("V1", Variables) | grepl ("mean ..", Variables) | grepl ("std ..", Variables))
tidydata = data.frame ()
tidydata <- mergedata [, Average == TRUE]

and finally it is filtered by activity on the line

Walking <-filter (tidybyActivity, V1 == as.integer (1))


V1 is the column of the type of activity, if you want to choose another one, the rule V1 == ..... must be followed.

1 == WALKING
2 == WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 == WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 == SITTING
5 == STANDING
6 == LAYING

and to get the averages
WalkingMean <-sapply (Walking, mean)
